                <p>It’s early morning and the lake is a sheet of glass. The hum of the inboard engine on the boat is music to your ears. You slip into your vest and dive in. You put your foot comfortably in your ski boot and the tow rope is now in your hand. It is time to throttle down and begin your adventure around the lake… HIT IT!
                    Who knew that when Ralph Samuelson designed the first water skis from two pine boards and successfully skied on Lake Pepin in Lake City, MN in 1922 that he would start a recreational sport that would attract millions.
                    Well the staff at Pine Lake Ski School would like to thank Mr. Samuelson because now when we go to work, our job is not only fun for us, but our customers, too.
                    Since 1974, PLSS has attracted people of all ages and skill levels. Whether you want to learn to ski for the first time or improve your skills for slaloming, barefooting or wakeboarding, each student receives one-on-one individualized attention from one of our talented instructors who will help you build your technique and your confidence.
                    Let Pine Lake Ski School help you accomplish your skiing goals!

                <p>Epic Wetsuits San Diego was started on the premise that the hard part about surfing should not be finding affordable gear. At Epic, we plan to solve that problem. Since we started in 2015, we have fine tuned our wetsuits to suit the needs of water skiers, wake boarders, surfers, surf schools, Stand Up Paddlers, Kayakers, free divers, swimmers, triathletes, snorkelers, scuba divers, lifeguards and water safety schools. Our goal is to keep dedicated athletes warm and able to train hard regardless of the conditions!
                One thing we are most proud of at Epic is the community of athletes and colleges like Michigan State University that keep us inspired to deliver top quality gear. 
                Welcome to Epic - GET WET AND HAVE FUN!</p>
