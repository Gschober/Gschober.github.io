                    Essentially took the lead for most tasks, including setting up meetings and making sure everyone was on top of things. Easier to get along with as time went on, and took on tasks that weren't initially his so we could progress efficiently. Pretty much worked with everyone so we could move forward with the game and all stay on the same page.

                    Great programmer- was able to write quickly and did most of the work and implementation for the more technical issues of our project.

                    He was basically our leader and also our lead programmer, took on a lot of responsibility but did an awesome job keeping up with everything and being able to help everyone when they needed it or had questions.
                </p>
                He did the majority of the programming for the game and it works fantastically. He is very good at what he does.
